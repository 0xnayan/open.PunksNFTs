## About The Project

  <p align="center">
   Welcome to my NFT minting website! This platform allows you to mint your own non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain(currently Goerli is working).

With the user-friendly interface, you can easily pay the required fee to mint the NFT. Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, your NFT is ready to be viewed and traded on NFT marketplaces(opensea).

Though currently this website is running on goerli testnet. I am working to deploy it in eth mainnet or polygon networks that will give you flexibility in choosing which network to use for your NFTs.

### Built With
Using tools:

- Solidity
- ReactJs
- Hardhat
- Metamask
- EthersJs
